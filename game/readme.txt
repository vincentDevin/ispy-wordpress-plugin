**Notes On Editing/Adding New I-Spy Games**

Our I-Spy JavaScript code is built to work with five object images linked in the html of each I-Spy Game. Each image is linked in the html twice, once in the “findImages” div and again in the “inventoryImages” div.
You do not need to do any work with the gamescript.js file if you want to use only five images.
 
If more than five images are required, you will have to modify the gamescript.js file to accommodate them. The areas in the JavaScript that would need to be edited are the two arrays “images” and “inventory.” 
The background image for your game can go into the img tag immediately before the “findImages” div, and doesn't require editing the Javascript. 

Once all the parts of the new I-Spy are ready, upload them to the site server under the folder “ispygame” which is located in the “public_html” file. 
Place or update the I-Spy html file you are working with in the root of the folder and upload any new images to a file within the “images” folder.
